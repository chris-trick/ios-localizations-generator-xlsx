# LocsUtil

[LocsUtil](https://github.com/martinkrasnocka/LocsUtil) is a simple utility for generating string resources for iOS projects. It uses XLSX document as an input, so it makes it very flexible to distribute it to managers, agencies, etc.

## Features

- MacOS command line application
- Generates string resource files for iOS project
- Supports localising permissions plist
- Uses XLSX document as an input
- Works with Google spreadsheets when exported (or synced) as an excel document
- MIT license

## Prerequsities
- Supports MacOS 10.9 or higher
- Needs xcodebuild to be installed (XCode command line tools)

## Installation and Setup

1. Run ./build.sh located in the root directory. Compiled executable will be placed under bin/locsutil.
```
cd into project root directory
./build.sh
```
2. Copy bin/locsutil to /usr/bin/locsutil.
```
sudo cp bin/locsutil /usr/local/bin/locsutil
```
3. Make it executable.
```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/locsutil
```

## Usage & Examples

### Running
```
locsutil <inputXslxFile> <outputDir> <configPlist>

Parameters:
    inputXslxFile - path to XLSX document
    outputDir - path to output dir
    configPlist - path to configuration plist file (optional)
```
See example.sh

### XLSX document format
- LocsUtil expects to find resources in the first sheet.
- Language identifiers are expected to be on the first line. A1 cell is skipped, as this column serves for keys. From B1, lanugages should be speficied, like "EN", "FR", etc.
- Translation keys are specified in the A column.

If you want to change this configuration, alter these lines in LocsGenerator.swift and rebuild.
```
let langRowIndex = 0 // Language definitions - row index in XSLSX document
let keyColumnId = "A" // Key definitions - column index in XSLSX document
```
Example XSLX document can be found at LocsUtil/input/localizations.xlsx

### Config plist (optional)
Use .plist file to generate additional string resource files, for example for localising Info.plist strings.

Example:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>InfoPlist</key>
    <dict>
        <key>track_journey_permission_location</key>
        <string>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</string>
        <key>permission_location_services_explanation</key>
        <string>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</string>
        <key>permission_camera_explanation</key>
        <string>NSCameraUsageDescription</string>
        <key>permission_photo_library_explanation</key>
        <string>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</string>
        <key>permission_add_photo_to_library</key>
        <string>NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription</string>
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```
Keys specified here will be put into "InfoPlist.plist" file. For example, "permission_location_services_explanation" will result into:
```
"NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription" = "Some translation";
```
Example config can be found in LocsUtil/input/config.plist

## Pro tip
Set the output directory directly to your project. Then it is easy to see changes from the XLXS in your version control tool.

## Removal
```
rm /usr/local/bin/locsutil
```
